This folder contains: 

1) Script test_Newick_from_f4s.py: 

    which uses a table of f4 statistics to test a phylogenetic tree in Newick format. 
    See the first section of the script for all details on necessary input and dependencies. 
    
2) Script compute_NJ_tree.R: 

    which computes a neighbor-joining tree from a table of outgroup f3 statistics
    (assuming ADMIXTOOLS format with the value of f3 in the 4th column, the 
    outgroup in the 3rd column, and population pairs in the 1st and 2nd columns). 
    See the first section of the script for details on dependencies. 

3) Compressed folder combined_find-graphs_results.zip: 

    which contains the full set of results from ADMIXTOOLS2's find_graphs ('computations' directory),
    as well as associated scripts.
    The 'results_summary.txt' file records the score, worst residual and hash for each winning model, 
    for each iteration; and the 'unique_results.txt' file provides the same information but keeping only
    one representative per unique topology hash.
