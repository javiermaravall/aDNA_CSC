This folder contains:

(a) Raw ADMIXTURE results: 

    1) ancient_SAs.zip: 

        contains results when using only ancient South American individuals as input ('Input_individuals.fam').
    
        'CVerrors.txt' and 'loglikelihoods.txt' record cross-validation errors and logLikelihoods for K ancestry components assumed and iteration i. 
        Folder 'runs' contains 'r_{K}_{i}' files, recording by-individual output for K ancestry components assumed and iteration i.
    
    2) ancients_and_moderns_SA_no-Karitiana_no-Surui.zip: 
    
        contains results when using ancient and modern (Reich et al. 2012, Nature) South American individuals as input ('Input_individuals.fam'). 
        The Karitiana and Surui populations were excluded, because they are known to be highly drifted and thus could bias ADMIXTURE results (Lawson et al. 2018, Nature Communications).
    
        'CVerrors.txt' and 'loglikelihoods.txt' record cross-validation errors and logLikelihoods for K ancestry components assumed and iteration i. 
        Folder 'runs' contains 'r_{K}_{i}' files, recording by-individual output for K ancestry components assumed and iteration i.

(b) A custom script 'f4_BY_correction.R' to correct f4-statistics Z-scores from ADMIXTOOLS using the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure.
